Thanks
======
I would like to acknowledge the work of others without which FreetypeKit.js wouldn't be possible:

* [FreeType](https://www.freetype.org/): for the nitty-gritty details and filling in the gaps when the spec was incomplete.
* [ONLYOFFICE-sdkjs](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/sdkjs): JavaScript SDK which is a part of ONLYOFFICE Document Server.
